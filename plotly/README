# Why choose dataset of Disney+ ?
Disney plus is one of the most popular streaming platforms. I would like to know more about the movies and TV shows on Disney Plus to understand why Disney managed to become one of the top streaming platforms despite launching later than others.

# Why choose PIE chart ?

  
The data we're interested in is the types of movies on the Disney Plus platform when categorized, a total of 43. We've analyzed which movie type is the most prevalent on the Disney Plus platform. Therefore, using a pie chart would be able to display the proportions of each type compared to other graphs.
Additionally, I have grouped movie types with less than 200 together, resulting in this group having the highest number of instances. 
However, in our pie chart, i have separated the largest portion of movie types to make it clearer.
